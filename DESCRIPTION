Description: Cancer genomes contain large numbers of somatic alterations but few
    genes drive tumor development. Identifying molecular cancer driver genes is
    critical for precision oncology. Most of current approaches either identify 
    driver genes based on mutational recurrence or using estimated scores 
    predicting the functional consequences of mutations. driveR is a tool for 
    scoring and ranking genes from somatic whole exome/genome sequencing 
    according to cancer driverness. As features, driveR uses coding impact 
    metaprediction scores, non-coding impact scores, somatic copy number 
    alteration scores, hotspot gene/double-hit gene condition, 'phenolyzer' gene
    scores and memberships to cancer-related KEGG pathways. It uses these 
    features to calculate cancer-type-specific driverness scores for each gene 
    using the related task of a multi-task learning model.
