Description: Cancer genomes contain large numbers of somatic alterations but few
    genes drive tumor development. Identifying molecular cancer driver genes is
    critical for precision oncology. Most of current approaches either identify 
    driver genes based on mutational recurrence or using estimated scores 
    predicting the functional consequences of mutations. driveR is a tool for 
    scoring and prioritizing genes from indiviual or batch somatic whole exome/genome 
    sequencing data according to cancer driverness. As features, driveR uses 
    coding impact metaprediction scores, non-coding impact scores, somatic copy 
    number alteration scores, hotspot gene/double-hit gene condition, 
    'phenolyzer' gene scores and memberships to cancer-related KEGG pathways. It 
    uses these features to estimate cancer-type-specific driverness probability for 
    each gene using the related task of a multi-task learning model.
